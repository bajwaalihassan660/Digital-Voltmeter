# Digital-Voltmeter
A pic microcontroller-based digital voltmeter
Digital Voltmeter with PIC16F877A Microcontroller
I designed a digital voltmeter using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. This project involved programming the microcontroller to measure voltage levels and display the readings on an LCD screen. I used analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) to convert the analog voltage signals to digital values accurately. This project enhanced my skills in microcontroller programming, circuit design, and interfacing electronic components.

Skills Gained:
Microcontroller Programming (PIC16F877A)
Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)
Circuit Design Proficiency
